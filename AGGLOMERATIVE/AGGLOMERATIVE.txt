Input - min,max,av as a metric
Output - A graph showing WSS variation with number of clusters

dist_cluster - Takes two clusters as input along with metric 'min', 'max', 'av' and it finds distance
between those two clusters

WSS - Takes in one cluster and gives out a WSS as output

An iteration will take two clusters which are closest according to the metric and merges them into one. It calculates WSS for specific number of clusters along the way and finally plots a graph.
