The divisive top-down clustering approach works by dividing the point set into two clusters and recursing.
This program takes the distance matrix in pickle format and returns the clusters formed at each iteration.

Input: Distance matrix of the point set(pkl file) and Level l.
Output: Top-down clustering and clusters at level l. WSS values are also printed with the clusters.

Instructions: Run using python3 only, Enter the level.
